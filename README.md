# Unsupervised Image Clustering
This is an unsupervised clustering algorithm for image classification of unkown sources.

PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity) for every input image needs to be previously computed. PRNU acts as an image fingerprint and should be similar for pictures taken from the same source.
